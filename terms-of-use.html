            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Nature of Service</h2>
            <p>
              Good Shepherd Land Company provides property evaluation and
              purchase services. By submitting property information through our
              Website, you are requesting a cash offer for your land. This
              submission does not create a binding obligation to sell your
              property.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">No Obligation to Sell</h3>
            <p>
              Submitting your property information does not obligate you to sell
              your property to us or accept any offer we may make. You are free
              to accept or decline any offer at your sole discretion.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">No Guarantee of Offer</h3>
            <p>
              While we strive to make offers on properties submitted to us, we
              reserve the right to decline to make an offer on any property for
              any reason, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Property does not meet our acquisition criteria</li>
              <li>
                Insufficient information provided to evaluate the property
              </li>
              <li>Title issues or legal complications</li>
              <li>Property location outside our service area</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Accuracy of Information</h3>
            <p>
              You represent and warrant that all information you provide about
              your property is accurate, complete, and not misleading. You
              acknowledge that any offers made by the Company will be based on
              the information you provide, and material misrepresentations may
              result in:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Withdrawal of any offer made</li>
              <li>Adjustment of the purchase price</li>
              <li>Termination of negotiations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Offers and Purchase Process</h2>
            <p>Any offer made by the Company is subject to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Verification of property information</li>
              <li>Title search and review</li>
              <li>Property inspection (if required)</li>
              <li>Confirmation of clear and marketable title</li>
              <li>Execution of a formal purchase agreement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              An offer does not constitute a binding contract until both parties
              have executed a formal purchase agreement. The Company reserves
              the right to modify or withdraw an offer at any time prior to
              execution of a purchase agreement.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">No Agency Relationship</h2>
            <p>
              Nothing in these Terms or in your use of the Service creates an
              agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship
              between you and the Company. We are not your real estate agent or
              broker, and we do not represent your interests in any real estate
              transaction. You are encouraged to seek independent legal and
              financial advice before accepting any offer or entering into any
              agreement.

              We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior

            <p>
              Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease
              immediately. If you have submitted property information and we
              have made an offer, termination of website access does not affect

            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
              shall the Company or its officers, directors, employees, or agents
              be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or
              punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits,
              data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the
                Service
              </li>
              <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the Service</li>
              <li>Any content obtained from the Service</li>
              <li>
                Unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or
                content
              </li>
              <li>
                Decisions made based on information provided through the Service
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The Company's total liability for any claims arising out of or
              relating to these Terms or the Service shall not exceed the amount
              you paid to the Company, if any, or $100 USD, whichever is
              greater.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental
              or consequential damages, which means that some of the above
              limitations may not apply to you. In these states, each party's
              liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
              The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with
              all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the
              maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its
              own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their
              respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims
              all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
              with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of
              merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
              non-infringement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without limiting the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty
              or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that:

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
              warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
              consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations
              may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and
              limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
              greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
            </p>

            </p>
